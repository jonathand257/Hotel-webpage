    <h1>Accomodation at Governors Camp</h1>
    <h2><em>Governors Camp Collection has a selection of award winning safari camps and lodges in the heart of East Africa's best game viewing areas</em></h2>
    <p Class="Intro">From Loldia House in Kenya's magnificent Great Rift Valley we invite you to begin a safari adventure with us. We have our own Cessna Caravan aircraft that we use to fly clients between camps, from Loldia House we can fly you direct to the Masai Mara to one of our camps (Governors Camp, Little Governors Camp, Il Moran Camp or Private Camp) which are all located in the heart of the best game viewing area of the Masai Mara National Reserve.</P>
    <p>Being located inside the National Reserve gives us a unique advantage as you are situated in the heart of the wildlife action in an area famed for its abundance of wildlife notably the big cats. From the Masai Mara we can fly you direct to Lake Victoria and Mfangano Island Camp where you can finish off your safari with a relaxing island break in what must be one of the most secluded spots in the world. For those seeking a wildlife adventure of a different kind we run Rwanda's first ever community owned lodge Sabyinyo Silverback Lodge on the edge of the Parc National des Volcans, the home to the highly endangered and utterly enthralling Mountain Gorilla.</p>

    <p class="content">Below is a list of our amazing accomodation in the heart of the Masai Mara</p>
      <ul>
        <li><Strong>Governors Camp</strong> - The setting is magical. So much so that almost a century ago it was reserved, exclusively, for Kenya’s colonial Governors. Governors’ Camp nestles in the forest along the winding banks of the Mara River, it’s waters teeming with bird-life, hippo and crocodile, in the heart of Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve.</li>

        <li><strong>Little Governors Camp</strong> - Little Governors’ is intimate in character, with just 17 luxury en-suite tents tucked around a large watering hole that teems with both birds and wildlife. The camp is approached by a boat ride across the Mara River, then an escorted walk through the riverine forest. Vehicles are left on the far river bank, and the camp is therefore quiet and undisturbed.</li>

        <li><strong>Il Moran Camp</strong> - The camp for those who want that extra bit of luxury. We’ve kept Governors’ IL Moran Camp small and intimate, with added touches that make this the top of the range safari. IL Moran is widely regarded as the premiere camp in the Masai Mara.</li>

        <li><strong>Governors Private Camp</strong> - The jewel in the Governors’ Camp crown; for those who want an exclusive taste of the Governors’ experience. Private Camp can either be booked by one family or group at a time, so it’s yours to enjoy, as the name suggests, in private or can be booked on a tent by tent basis. It means up to 16 people have, to themselves, a beautiful bend of the Mara River.</li>
