      <ul>
        <li><Strong>Game Viewing</strong>Governors’ Camp properties combine superb locations in the Masai Mara with custom designed vehicles and exceptionally highly trained and experienced guides to give our clients un-matched game-viewing and photographic opportunities in the world’s prime wildlife area. We are in the heart of what is widely considered to be the best game viewing area of the Masai Mara. Our vehicles are custom built 4 wheel drive landrovers. We take you out twice a day on a game drive into the famous Masai Mara Game Reserve and surrounding areas. Our driver-guides are hand-picked and nurtured by us. They undergo a continuous guide training scheme mentored by experts in the field. Having operated in the Masai Mara for 40 years our driver-guides have an un-paralleled knowledge of the reserve combined with a deep understanding and respect for the sanctity of this wilderness area, its flora and its fauna.</li>

        <li><strong>Hot Air Ballooning</strong>For those looking for a wildlife viewing adventure of a different kind we offer Hot Air Balloon Safaris over the Masai Mara. The adventure begins just before dawn. Departure is from a perfect natural launch site behind Little Governors’ Camp, flames from the hot air balloon burners light the darkness as the crews inflate their craft. The first, pink tongues of sunlight flicker across the skies as the hot air balloon fills, then rises. Suspended in a basket beneath the rainbow-coloured canopy, you’re off for a wildlife viewing adventure with an entirely different perspective.

        <li><strong>Walking Safari</strong>Leave your vehicle behind and take a walking safari with one of our experienced and qualified naturalists for the true thrill of the bush. Down on the same level as the animals you will experience the untamed beauty of the Mara. Our walking safaris take place in a private concession area adjacent to the Masai MaraGame Reserve, where the scenery differs from inside the Reserve and picturesque acacia trees dot the hilly landscape.</li>

        <li><strong>Wildebeest Migration</strong>After the rains when the first flush of grass turns the Masai Mara’s golden savannah green, the most mesmerising wildlife spectacle anywhere takes place here: The Great Wildebeest Migration. Between the months of July and October one and a half million wildebeest, accompanied by vast numbers of zebra and gazelles make the long and dangerous trek from drier lands in Tanzania, northwards to this corner of Kenya.</li>
